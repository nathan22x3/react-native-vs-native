\subsection{When to Use Native App Development}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item You require the performance that native frameworks offer.
  Especially if you're creating a game, utilizing a device's 3D/AR/VR capabilities, or developing an otherwise complex
  application.
  \item You have the resources and processes in place to meet the logistical demands of running two mobile development
  streams concurrently.
  \item You intend to target a single platform for your app – Android or iOS only – and you do not anticipate this
  changing.
  \item Direct access to device capabilities is required, which only native can provide.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{When to Use React Native}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item You want to create a cross-platform app with a simple use case.
  \item You want to create a prototype or MVP as soon as possible.
  Even if you plan to use native development to bring a product to market, React Native is a great way to get
  something up and running quickly.
  This can be a valuable test of the framework's viability for your specific use case – perhaps native isn't required
  after all.
  You intend to target a single platform for your app – Android or iOS only – and you do not anticipate this changing.
  \item You want the logistical advantages that a hybrid framework offers: a single codebase and supporting
  development process, which typically results in cost savings.
\end{enumerate}
