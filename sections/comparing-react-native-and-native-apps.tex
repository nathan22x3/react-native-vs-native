React Native is mostly written in JavaScript and is categorized as a ``hybrid'' framework, which means it is
platform-independent.
This distinguishes it from standard Android apps written in native languages such as Java or Kotlin, and Apple
apps written in Swift or Objective-C. Instead, hybrid applications use a single codebase to create an app that
works on both Android and iOS devices.
When compared to building two native apps in different languages, the benefit is obvious: \textbf{less code and
related logistics}.
The drawbacks of hybrids are that they aren't as fast as their native counterparts and can't always make full use
of a device's resources.
